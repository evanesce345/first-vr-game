# Cardboard Archery

I believe my project is a game because it is a closed system with predefined rules and an overarching goal for players to work towards. As soon as the game begins, it is clear that the player is meant to shoot the targets on screen. There is added endogenous value and challenge to the game as it becomes a race against the clock to hit as many targets as possible before the time runs out. An important aspect that that makes the project a game is the ability to win or lose. If the player does not hit enough targets within the minute, they lose the game. This can be expanded upon if I were to add more levels, whereby the player would need to beat the level to move on.

*I screwed up the repo and I don't know how to fix it so all the project files are in the master branch for some reason.*
